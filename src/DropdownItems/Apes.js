                <p>AEPS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) is a system that enables financial transactions through the use of Aadhaar, India's biometric-based unique identification system. AEPS allows customers to perform basic banking transactions, such as balance inquiry, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, and money transfer, through Aadhaar authentication. This system provides an alternative channel for
                 financial transactions for people who don't have access to traditional banking services.</p>
