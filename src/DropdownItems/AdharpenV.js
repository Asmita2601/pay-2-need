                <p>Aadhaar-PAN linking is the process of linking your Permanent Account Number
                 (PAN) with your Aadhaar number. The Indian government has made it mandatory to
                  link PAN with Aadhaar for filing tax returns. This linking helps in preventing
                   individuals from holding multiple PAN cards and can be done through the
                    official e-filing portal of the Income Tax Department of India or by visiting
                     a PAN service center.</p>
