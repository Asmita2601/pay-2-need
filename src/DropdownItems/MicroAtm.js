                <p>Micro ATM is a device used to dispense cash and perform other financial transactions in rural or remote areas where conventional ATMs are not available. It is usually smaller in size compared to conventional ATMs and can be operated using a mobile phone or a biometric reader. Micro ATMs can be used for a variety of financial transactions, including cash withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries. They play a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion and accessibility in areas that are underserved by traditional banking services.</p>
