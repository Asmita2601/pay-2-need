                <h2>Aadhar Pay</h2>
                <p>Aadhaar Pay is a digital payment system in India that allows people to
                 make transactions using their Aadhaar number and biometric information 
                 (fingerprint scan or iris scan) instead of cash, card, or other physical 
                 means of payment. It was launched by the government of India as a way to 
                 promote cashless transactions and financial inclusion for people who may not have access to traditional banking services. Aadhaar Pay can be used for making payments for various purposes, including utility bills, mobile recharge, and money transfer. To use Aadhaar Pay, merchants need to have a device with biometric authentication capabilities, and consumers need to have an Aadhaar number linked to a bank account.</p>
